## What's your problem?
A call center is receiving customer complaints of hold times that are too long. Customers are becoming aggrevated and having a poor experience, the representatives are dealing with high levels of stress due to aggrevated customers, and some customers decide to hang up before reaching a representative. This leads to lower sales and unresolved issues for the customers.
